# Matchesfashion Front End Coding Challenge


## Introduction

The test is broken up into a few steps which will be displayed in the next section.
We ask that you limit the use of libraries, and just implement the code using
JS/HTML & CSS. To fetch the data, please use [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch). 

## Set Up

We have created a basic node server you can use by installing [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and running `http-server` in node command prompt in the `src` folder.  

The basic page should be viewable in a browser on `http://localhost:8080/`

## The Problem

Your solution is to be completed within the folder

> src/

There is some generic HTML and CSS there you are welcome to use. 

The app that you are required to build is a simple product listing page. Product infomation should be fetched from the sub folder

> products/

## The Task

The task is to:
1. Display the first 12 proucts in a grid up to 4 columns wide.
2. Show a load more button that loads an additional 12 products.
3. Make sure the page works on big and small devices (1 or 2 columns on mobile).

Bonus task:
4. Allow the user to sort by price low to high
